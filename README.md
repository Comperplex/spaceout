# spaceout 🚀

Spaceout is a web game where you try to protect your beacon and attack others with drones. These drones are trainable AIs, and training them is a major part of gameplay.

This is currently in development and is not meant to be live. Nobody outside of Comperplex is allowed to use the code in the repository, though this will change once we enter beta.
